- Clone this repository and run the **ALL_DETAILS.ipynb** notebook to get **all_details_2011-20.csv**..This csv file is used to build the PowerBI Dashboard.

## INSIGHTS:
- The dataset consists of  the GHG emissions and the Energy consumption by various sectors, Organizations, etc.
- The maximum greenhouse gases emitted was in the year 2013-1.29 trillion kgs
- The maximum energy was consumed in the year 2011-75.75 billion ekwh/sq.ft
- From 2014 to 2020 there was a gradual decrease in the emission of GHG and the energy consumption was also less.
But the GHG emitted by school sector is very high compared to other sectors and even though it has still decreased over the years. 

## SUGGESTIONS:
- The school and indoor recreation operations emit more GHG than other operations.
- Authorities has to make sure whether the energy consumption is genuine or wasted by students/faculty.
- Also they need to find why so much of GHG has been emitted by the above sectors.
- The highest GHG emitting cities are Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton, Brampton .Monitor and regulate these cities by passing laws that are meant to reduce GHG and preserve the environment and ecosystem, to pass on a green planet to the next generation.
